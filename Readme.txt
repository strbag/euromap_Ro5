How to use:

1. Copy your Ro5 Excel sheets into the Excel Folder of this application.

2. Launch euromap_v3.0.exe and follow the instructions.

3. The KML Files can be found in the Kml Folder of this application.


What it does:

The application generates a Kml file for each Excel file you placed in the Excel folder.
The Placemarks will be colored according to their Activity concentration: 
from green (0) to red (Activity Limit) in 512 steps leading through yellow (0.5*Activity Limit).
The Activity Limit can be set by the user.
Any Placemark with an Activity Concentration Value above the Activity Limit will be colored red.
The following units will be automatically converted for the color scheme: µBq, mBq, Bq

The Kml Files can then be imported either into My Maps by Google https://www.google.com/maps/about/mymaps/ (Google account needed) or in Google Earth

Because the Excel files can contain more than one measurement per location,
the kml files will be generated so that the highest Concentration Values will be displayed per location.
